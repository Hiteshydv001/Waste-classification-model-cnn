## 📚 How It Works

1. **Upload or Capture** an image of the waste.
2. The image is processed and resized to match the input requirements of the model.
3. A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** predicts whether the waste is:
   - **Organic** (e.g., food scraps, plants).
   - **Inorganic** (e.g., plastics, metals).
4. The result is displayed along with a **bounding box** around the waste object and a **confidence score**.
